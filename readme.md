**Audio Deepfake Detector** is a specialized tool designed to verify the authenticity of vocal recordings. By analyzing acoustic patterns and spectral features, it can identify whether an audio file is a genuine human recording or a synthetic voice generated by AI (Deepfake).

This project is an implementation of my undergraduate thesis research at **Darussalam Gontor University**, focusing on **Semi-Supervised Contrastive Learning** for audio feature representation.
